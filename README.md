## Inspiration

Good communication between government and general public is still a tedious process .With our website we are trying to be medium between government authorities and general public.

## What it does?

Awaaz is an informative website , build for establishing communication. We take complaints from public and through us , their complains are sent to authorities concerned. It provides platform to user to express their concerns to government institution.

## How we built it?

We built it using html , CSS , Bootstrap and Django framework , postgreSQL .
We used github for file management. 

## Challenges we ran into?

It was our first time using Unity. Our team decided to work and explore a completely new domain.
It was quite a challenge to not only learn about backend and unity but also make a prototype of website with it that too only in 24 hours!! But hurray we made it.


## Accomplishments that we're proud of?

We are proud that this project is ready for use.
Most importantly we are proud of ourselves as we learnt and implemented everything and made an amazing game in just 24 hours.


## Future Scopes
